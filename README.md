DHTesp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/beegee-tokyo/DHTesp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/beegee-tokyo/DHTesp)
===

Forked from https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/DHTesp

The only difference with respect to the parent library is a workaround that allows working with a faulty sensor that provides negative temperature measurements in an unexpected format. The parent library should be your first choice to run the DHT sensors. This fork is useful only for faulty sensors.
